# 1. Use the Commit Template
# You have already created a commit template in .gitmessage. This helps you maintain the structure for your commits.
#
# 2. Write the Commit Message
# When you make a commit, open the editor to write the message. Here’s how to do it:
#
# Stage Changes:
# git add .
#
# Execute Commit:
# git commit
#
# Editor Opens:
# Your template will be displayed. Fill it out by adding the relevant information. For example:
# feat(ui): add dark mode toggle
# Implement a toggle for dark mode in the UI to enhance user experience.
# BREAKING CHANGE: The default theme is now dark.
#
# 3. Commit Types
# Here are the types you can use:
#
# feat: for new features
# fix: for bug fixes
# docs: for documentation changes
# style: for formatting changes that do not affect logic (e.g., whitespace, formatting)
# refactor: for code changes that do not add new features or fix bugs
# test: for adding or modifying tests
# chore: for changes that do not affect the code (e.g., build processes)
#
# 4. Example Commits
# Here are some examples of how to formulate your commits:
#
# Adding a New Feature:
# feat(panel): add resizable panel functionality
#
# Bug Fix:
# fix(webview): resolve issue with webview not loading

#
# 5. Execute the Commit
# After you have filled out the message, save and close the editor. Your commit will then be created with the specified message.
